The key thing for this assignment is that you need to remember that your computers are a self-defined class, not a dictionary.
The one bug I had in trying to convert main was nothing fancy, I simply forgot to change computer["year made"] into something 
compatable with the class. I also had some difficulties with what 'memory' meant as an input, but as a whole this is very straight-forwards.
I don't think I found anything I would need to give advice about.
